Case Study : Banking Application


 


A staff member can deposit or withdraw cash on behalf of the


customer  based on his/her account number. Each of these transactions are stored in the table bankusertransaction.


The account_info_table maintains one record which always stores the current/latest balance for


that particular account. These details are updated in the appropriate table using the servlet and the


model class(AccountOperation) given below.


Http being a stateless protocol, when multiple interactions happen between the same customer and


the server, the account no which is entered by the staff member in the first form is not available


when the deposit/withdrawal information is entered. So the account no. is stored


as an attribute in an HttpSession object.
